									<h2>Important Note!</h2>
									<p>


										The Crops Farmer dApps is a decentralized application built on the Binance Smart
										Chain. The object of the game is to hire more farmers sooner and more often than
										other farmers. This in turn earns you more BNB faster. These Farmers work for
										you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of 6% of your farmers' value.

										The daily percentage return depends on farmers' actions that are taken within
										the platform that impact the farmers's efficiency rate. The farming efficiency
										rate rises and falls as users buy Farmers, re-hire your earnings and sell your
										Crops for BNB.

										Once Farmers are Bought, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to re-hire
										them (either through hire or re-hiring) cannot be taken back. However, once
										bought, Farmers will not stop producing yield.
									<p>

										The Crops Farmer has several anti-dumping and anti-whale measures in place to
										ensure the longevity of the project. These measures include maximum deposits, as
										well as a cutoff time AND a cooldown time for withdrawals.
									<p>
										The cutoff time is the amount of time it will take for your "cart" to be full of
										rewards. Once the bag is full, it will stop filling until you've taken some
										action in the game. This is to prevent whales from letting their rewards
										accumulate for a long time, and removes the false impression the contract value
										is going up when most of it is rewards the whale is waiting to withdraw at once.
									<p>
										The withdraw cooldown time is the amount of time one has to wait before they can
										make another withdrawal. This also prevents the contract balance from decreasing
										in value too fast. If the team decides it's necessary to protect the contract
										balance, this time period can be adjusted to slow down the rate of withdrawals,
										but it can only be set to a value less than or equal to 24 hours (per contract
										rules).

										The compound count is the number of times the user has compounded.
									<p>
										By default, the required compound count by the platform is 10, meaning the user
										will have to compound 10 times(compound once every 12 hours) before they can
										withdraw without the feedback tax of 80%. This feature in essense will ensure
										the longevity and stability of the project.

										To reward users who compound, there is a bonus when you re-hire your daily crops
										earnings instead of selling them. The bonus increases 2% every 12 hours that you
										compound without withdrawing (20% max after 5 days). This incentivizes the user
										to compound more often, which will help boost the farms efficiency rate in the
										long run. To be able to utilize the re-hire bonus feature, the player must not
										compound before the provided timer reaches 00:00:00.
									<p>
										For the farmers who choose to not play the game and only sell, there will be a
										80% tax on those sells that will stay in the contract. If the player makes two
										or more consecutive sells, this tax will be applied. The only way for the user
										to not pay the 80% tax is to compound 10 times before making another withdrawal.
									<p>
										The Crops Farmer also has a very unique feature that has never been done before
										which effectively decreases the amount of farmers inflation that occurs over a
										long period of time. Every sell action will only add 50% of the amount sold to
										the total supply. Older miner add 100% of what is sold to the total supply. This
										means the contract will have a lower inflation rate, keeping the farmers supply
										more scarce and more valuable than other miner platforms.
									<p>
										This platform work similarly to a financial market, where an asset has intrinsic
										value that is relative to the supply or demand of said asset. Farmers are
										purchased with a pre-determined currency at a price relative to the Farmers's
										current farming efficiency rate. After the Farmers are purchased, they go to
										work for you right away to give you the best yield on your investment possible,
										for as long as possible. Just as any other asset bought and sold on an open
										market, the price of a Farmers will fluctuate over time, as will the farming
										efficiency rate, as you and other farmers recruit Farmers, compound earnings and
										sell earnings. To put it plainly, the more demand for the Farmers, the more they
										will increase in value and the more yield they will produce. Inversely, when the
										demand decreases, so will the value of the Farmers and their daily return on
										investment.
									<p>
										The main difference between a this game and a traditional financial market is
										that a recruited Farmers cannot be sold, only the value they provide can be
										sold. As the farmers of the game as a whole compound their earnings and make new
										deposits, the game efficiency rate will stay relatively constant, but the moment
										farmers start to sell more than they are compounding, the efficiency rate will
										begin to drop as to preserve the TVL and longevity of the game.
